Churn is the rate at which customers discontinue doing business with a company over time for one or more reasons. As a result, the telecommunications company wishes to develop a classifier capable of predicting increased revenues by minimizing customer churn in the organization."

Finally, this effort aims to help SyriaTel reduce financial losses due to churn, increase overall customer retention rates, and improve business tactics to boost profitability."

We can also observe that we didn't have any missing values or duplicated values in the dataset and this enabled us to conduct this project without any challenges.The data is divided into categorical and numerical values."
